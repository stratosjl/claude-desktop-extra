# Local GrowthBook feature-flag overrides via <userData>/claude-desktop-extra.json.
#
# GrowthBook flags are served by Anthropic (/api/desktop/features) with no local
# override layer (the fcache disk cache is safeStorage-encrypted). This patch adds
# one: every load path (network fetch, disk cache, deployment-mode hardcoded set)
# funnels through a single features-store setter; we hook its head so a user's
# claude-desktop-extra.json (JSONC - comments allowed; auto-created template on
# first run) is merged over the freshly loaded map. Overrides are applied on a
# shallow copy, so the caller's raw payload (which feeds the disk cache) stays
# untouched. Layering: user override > server rollout.
#
# NOTE: flags that our patches force at the call site (enable_local_agent_mode
# etc. rewrite the read to !0) never consult the store, so this file cannot
# affect them - documented in the template and README.
#
# Sub-patches:
#   A: inject js/growthbook_overrides.js (defines globalThis.__cdbApplyGbOverrides)
#      at the very top of index.js (runs before any chunk code)
#   B: hook the features-store setter: function X(e){let t=Mx;Mx=e,Nx=!0;...
#      anchored on the stable log string "[growthbook] loaded %d features (%d changed)"
#
# Sub-patch A used to insert after the leading `"use strict";` directive. That
# anchor DIED in v1.26832.0: the bundle now opens with a Sentry IIFE and has no
# directive prologue, while the literal `"use strict";` still occurs deep inside
# a vendored template literal (`E(`"use strict"; return (`+e+`).constructor;`)`)
# - so a `find`-based anchor reported success while splicing the whole IIFE into
# the middle of a string. We prepend at offset 0 instead: index.js is a CJS
# module with no prologue and is `require`d by index.pre.js (package.json main),
# so offset 0 is both statement-level and earlier than every chunk.
#
# Break risk: LOW - A has no pattern left to break; B anchors on a log string
# that has been stable across releases. If upstream splits the setter or renames
# the log line, B fails loud.
#
# Uses the `regex` package (pure Nim) like the other patches: std/nre dlopens
# PCRE1 at run time, which ubuntu-24.04 (the CI harness runner) does not ship.
# `regex` has no backreferences, so the "transform is called on the setter's
# first parameter" constraint that used to be `\2` is an equality check on the
# captured groups; its repetition ranges are capped at 100, so the 200-char
# window between the keys count and the log line is two 100-char runs.

#     n=Object.entries(lf).filter(...);v.info("[growthbook] loaded %d features (%d changed)",...)
# v1.26832.0 shape (new minifier: `let` instead of `const`, backtick literals,
# separate `let` for the second binding, dotted logger callee):
#   function tS(e){let t=Mx;Mx=e,Nx=!0;let n=Object.keys(Mx).length,
#     i=Object.entries(Mx).filter(...).length;r.o.info(`[growthbook] loaded %d features (%d changed)`,n,i)
# v1.34493.1 shape: the setter takes a SECOND parameter (a source/status tag,
# stored first), the dirty flag is gone, and the stored value now funnels
# through a TRANSFORM - the deployment-mode hardcoded-features filter, which
# used to be a separate load path calling the setter:
#   function Fit(e,t){OS=t;let n=DS;DS=jit(e);let r=Object.keys(DS).length,
#     i=Object.entries(DS).filter(...).length;D.info(`[growthbook] loaded %d features (%d changed)`,r,i)
# We now wrap the TRANSFORM CALL (`jit(e)`) rather than reassigning the raw
# parameter: overrides must apply to the map that is actually STORED, after
# the hardcoded-mode filter - same layering as before, when the hardcoded set
# itself arrived through the setter's parameter (user override > any rollout).
# Groups: 0 = head "function F(e,t){OS=t;let n=DS;DS=", 1 = e (first param),
# 2 = transform call "jit(e)", 3 = e again (must equal group 1), 4 = tail
# ";let r=Object.keys(DS).length...loaded %d features...".
