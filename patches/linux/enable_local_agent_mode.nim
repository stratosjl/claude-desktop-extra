#
# Enable Code and Cowork features on Linux.
#
# Two sub-patches:
#   3  async feature merger overrides (quietPenguin, louderPenguin, computerUse,
#      computerUseRollout, plus three inert safety nets - see the comment at
#      the sub-patch)
#   4  preferences defaults (quietPenguinEnabled / louderPenguinEnabled)
#
# Retired 2026-09-23 (v2.7032.0, AGENTS.md Rule 4):
#   1  platform gate on the quietPenguin support function. The registry consumes
#      it as `quietPenguin:X(fn)` where `X(e){return app.isPackaged?
#      {status:"unavailable"}:e()}`, so the function is never called in a
#      packaged build; quietPenguin is delivered by sub-patch 3 alone.
#   1b yukonSilver guard and the anthropic-client-os-platform header guard:
#      assert-only, changed no bytes. Cowork support on Linux is upstream's
#      native determiner (linux -> "unix" VM-bundle key, gated on the KVM probe);
#      never force yukonSilver here.
#   2  chillingSlothLocal: printed [OK] with no check at all.
#   3's pre-v1.13 `const X=async()=>({...})` fallback: zero matches since.
#   The stale-input check for the removed navigator spoof marker
#   (`__nav_spoof_applied`) now lives in scripts/apply_patches.py
#   (STALE_INPUT_MARKERS), which refuses a pre-patched extract for every patch.
#
# (Sub-patches 3b-3p, the GrowthBook rollout-bypass forces, were RETIRED
# 2026-07-13: none of those flags is platform-gated, every read consults the
# feature store, and add_growthbook_overrides.nim gives users a supported
# one-line opt-in via claude-desktop-extra.jsonc growthbookOverrides. All
# retired IDs are listed in the .jsonc template for re-enabling. Patches
# 5/5b/6/8, the MSIX-era platform spoofs, were removed 2026-07-01 for issue
# #173: the official Linux .deb reports "linux" natively.)
#
# This patch targets index.js only.

  # Patch 3: Override features in the async feature merger.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: do NOT force-override the Cowork VM capability features
  # (yukonSilver / yukonSilverGems / coworkKappa / coworkArtifacts) here. Those
  # are gated by upstream's NATIVE VM-capability probe (/dev/kvm, OVMF
  # firmware, qemu, virtiofsd and the bundled helper). Slamming yukonSilver to
  # "supported" would MASK a real unavailable state (KVM-less host, missing
  # firmware/qemu), so the UI would advertise Cowork and then fail at VM spawn
  # with a generic error instead of the honest "install QEMU / add to kvm
  # group" message.
  #
  # We override the features we genuinely provide the backend for on Linux.
  # Four of the seven are LOAD-BEARING and three are inert safety nets
  # (re-verified v3.1623.0) - keep the distinction honest:
  #   quietPenguin   NEEDED  registry gives X(fn) -> unavailable when packaged
  #   louderPenguin  NEEDED  darwin/win32 + flag 4116586025 gated
  #   computerUse    NEEDED  since v2.19675.1 the platform Set includes linux,
  #                          but Wayland is only "supported" when upstream's
  #                          RemoteDesktop portal probe answers (wlroots and
  #                          portal-less sessions get unsupported_session), and
  #                          the account flag 3676943315 gates it; our bridges
  #                          cover those sessions, so we override it
  #   computerUseRollout NEEDED  the claude.ai SPA decides whether CU is shown
  #                          and bound to a chat from THIS key (v3.1623.0,
  #                          ion-dist shared-26: `cD(webGateOn,rolloutStatus)`
  #                          = rolloutStatus==="supported" || (==="unavailable"
  #                          && the account's web `chicago` gate is on); any
  #                          other state renders "Computer use isn't available
  #                          on the Team and Enterprise plans yet" / "isn't
  #                          enabled for your account yet" and never binds the
  #                          computer_* tools). Upstream's registry entry is
  #                          "supported" only through the Linux rollout flag
  #                          3676943315 + chicago_config, else "unsupported"
  #                          (not_enabled) or "unavailable". So without this
  #                          key the main process announces the tools
  #                          (fix_computer_use_linux) while the web hides them
  #                          for every account whose web gate is off (Team,
  #                          Enterprise). The SPA checks complianceBlocked
  #                          (web `taint:hipaa_regulated` + the desktop's
  #                          computerUseComplianceGate) BEFORE the rollout, so
  #                          an org compliance lock still wins.
